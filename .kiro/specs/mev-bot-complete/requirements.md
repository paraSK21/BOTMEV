# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete Flashbots-inspired low-latency MEV bot for HyperEVM. The system will provide end-to-end mempool ingestion, simulation, and bundle execution on Hyperliquid mainnet with dummy-value transactions, designed to be mainnet-ready from the ground up. The bot must achieve production-grade performance with median detection latency ≤20ms, decision loop ≤25ms, and simulation throughput ≥200 sims/sec.

## Requirements

### Requirement 6: Robust Configuration and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want secure key management and flexible configuration, so that I can safely operate on mainnet.
