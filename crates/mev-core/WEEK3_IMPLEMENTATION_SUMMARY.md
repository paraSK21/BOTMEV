### ✅ Task 3.3: Victim Generator and Deterministic Testing
- **VictimGenerator**: Predictable large swaps using dummy tokens for controlled testing
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-built scenarios for arbitrage, sandwich, and multi-DEX testing
- **Deterministic Validation**: Reproducible bundle ordering success validation
- **Demo Script**: End-to-end testing framework with comprehensive metrics
- **Tests**: 5 tests validating victim generation and scenario execution

### ✅ Task 3.4: Mainnet Dry Run with Dummy Values
- **MainnetDryRun**: Safe mainnet testing with 1 wei transactions
- **Live Mempool**: Real HyperEVM mainnet connection with transaction monitoring
- **Inclusion Metrics**: Comprehensive analysis of bundle success rates and latency
- **Safety Measures**: Dummy value protection to prevent financial risk
- **Tests**: 4 tests ensuring safe dry run execution

### ✅ Task 3.5: Failure Handling and Security Measures
- **FailureHandler**: Comprehensive failure detection and recovery system
- **Kill Switch**: Emergency shutdown functionality with multiple activation triggers
- **Rollback Logic**: Automatic transaction rollback for failed operations
- **Security Checklist**: Operational security validation framework
- **Operational Runbook**: Complete deployment and maintenance procedures
- **Tests**: 5 tests covering all failure scenarios and security measures
