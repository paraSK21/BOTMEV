# HyperLiquid EVM Mempool Status

## Current Situation

Your bot is now running, but there's a critical issue:

### ❌ Problem: HyperLiquid EVM doesn't support pending transactions

The error you're seeing:
```
ERROR Polling error: Pending block is null - the endpoint may not support pending transactions
```

This means **HyperLiquid's EVM RPC endpoint does not expose pending transactions**.

## What This Means

HyperLiquid EVM is different from standard Ethereum:
- ❌ No `eth_getBlockByNumber("pending")` support
- ❌ No `eth_subscribe("newPendingTransactions")` support  
- ❌ No mempool visibility

This is intentional - HyperLiquid uses a different consensus mechanism that doesn't have a public mempool like Ethereum.

## Your Options

### Option 1: Monitor Confirmed Blocks (Recommended)
Instead of pending transactions, monitor newly confirmed blocks:
- Subscribe to new block headers
- Process transactions as they're confirmed
- Still very fast (HyperLiquid has ~1 second block times)

### Option 2: Use HyperLiquid DEX Trades
The DEX WebSocket feed gives you real-time trades:
- See trades as they happen
- Get price movements instantly
- This is what I already implemented (currently disabled)

### Option 3: Run Your Own Validator
If you run a HyperLiquid validator, you might have access to pending transactions.

## Recommendation

**Enable the HyperLiquid DEX integration** - it's already working and gives you real-time market data:

```yaml
hyperliquid:
  enabled: true  # Enable this
```

The bot will receive:
- Real-time BTC, ETH, SOL, ARB trades
- Price updates as they happen
- Trade volume and direction

This is likely what you actually want for MEV opportunities on HyperLiquid.

## Alternative: Monitor Confirmed Blocks

If you really want EVM transactions (not DEX trades), I can modify the code to:
1. Subscribe to new block headers
2. Process transactions from each new block
3. React to confirmed transactions (still very fast)

Let me know which approach you prefer!
